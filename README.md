calculogue
==========

The Calculogue (with apologies to SIL International) is an exercise in comparative programming.

The Calculogue consists of a specification for a tiny programming language, called TISBL, and a
number of TISBL interpreters in a number of different languages, each with commentary on how
it differs from the last.

The baseline interpreter is written in THINK Pascal; this was the first compiled language I learned.
