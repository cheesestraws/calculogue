- Perl is /really/ odd.
- Read perlobj.
- Accessing parameters by @_.
- eval/die is peculiar.
- completely different approach to objects
- ->isa() vs. ->can()

- Being able to build constructors that return subclass clusters handy
  but open to misuse
  
- Simple DSL for stdlib - see TISBLModule.pm
- quotelike operators
- regexes!
	- make string */string div much easier
- <> operator
- startling errors

todo:
- use confess
- rewrite \verb
- fix pascal versions to use float division not int
- and java to make sure I'm posting float not int on div
