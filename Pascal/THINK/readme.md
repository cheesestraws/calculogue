TISBL for THINK Pascal======================This is a TISBL interpreter written in non-object-oriented procedural Pascal for the Macintosh System 7.  The dialect in use is THINK's, which is very similar to other Pascal dialects in use on the Mac at this period - possessing units for modularisation and some degree of implementation hiding, and enough extra goodies to make the use of the Macintosh Toolbox feasible.  This version barely uses the toolbox; to make comparisons clearer across platforms it uses the standard Pascal read/write mechanism for textual I/O.  The dialect of Pascal that THINK uses did in fact have object-oriented features; this interpreter doesn't use them.System requirements-------------------This is 68k code.  It'll work on anything System 7+.  Probably including Classic under OS X, but I've not tried it!It works fine under Basilisk II.To get this to run------------------The binary application is in macstuff.sit.  Unstuff the archive, run the application and choose a TISBL source file.  To build it-----------You need:* A classic mac!  Or Basilisk II/SheepShaver/MiniMac with System 7.* Think Pascal 4.5 with Ingemar's UPI: see www.think-pascal.org, though the software seems to have vanished from there* This folderUn-stuff macstuff.sit into the current folder.  You'll get tisbl.&pi; and tisbl.rsrc.  This archive contains the files which need their resource forks intact.Open tisbl.&pi; in THINK Pascal and tell it to run!  You may need to increase the amount of memory available to the application in Run -> Run Options and to increase the amount of memory available to THINK Pascal itself (quit it and change its memory allocation in its Get Info window).Things to note :-- Interesting ProcPtr tricks- NewHandle- Toolbox stuff largely restricted to tisbl.p- Mixed use of var parameters and pointers- 32k for  variables at each level only!Things to poke :-tests=1 at the top of tisbl.p turns on/off whether to run tests before the program runs_SIZE constants change various stuff but note previous statement about 32krewriting the whole lot to use handles is left as an excercise for the reader
