System requirements :-This is 68k code.  It'll work on anything System 7+.  Probably including Classic under OS X, but I've not tried it!It works fine under Basilisk II.To get this to work :-The binary application is in macstuff.sit.  To build :-You need:* A classic mac!  Or Basilisk II/SheepShaver/MiniMac with System 7.* Think Pascal 4.5 with Ingemar's UPI: see www.think-pascal.org, though the software seems to have vanished from there* This folderUn-stuff macstuff.sit into the current folder.  You'll get tisbl.¹ and tisbl.rsrc.  This archive contains the files which need their resource forks intact.Open tisbl.¹ in THINK Pascal and tell it to run!  You may need to increase the amount of memory available to the application in Run -> Run Options, or to Things to note :-- Interesting ProcPtr tricks- NewHandle- Toolbox stuff largely restricted to tisbl.p- Mixed use of var parameters and pointers- 32k for  variables at each level only!Things to poke :-tests=1 at the top of tisbl.p turns on/off whether to run tests before the program runs_SIZE constants change various stuff but note previous statement about 32krewriting the whole lot to use handles is left as an excercise for the reader
